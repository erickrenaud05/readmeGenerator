## Description
This read me generator uses nodejs to create a readme file based on command line prompts. This readme generator will create a professional readme based on needed readme section and your selection of optional section. 

## Usage
Once installed, make sure you are in the project directory. From here run node index.js and fill out the prompts. This will create a professional readme file in the directory titled 'yourReadme'. After the file is completed, verify the contents of the readme are as you intended. Then simply take this readme and put it in your intended projects repository. Here is a video demonstrating how to use this generator: [Demonstration](UsageScreenRecording\Module9ScreenRecording.mp4)

## Installation

If you receive a message indicating you do not have node, please visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer/current and download the current version. Once you've made sure you have node.js, fork this repository and clone it to your local machine. Then go to the project repository in your terminal and run npm install to install the dependents needed to run this project.
